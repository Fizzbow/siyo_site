summary: Breaking down the subtle "lift up" transition used in tools like Linear, and rebuilding a reusable loading pattern in Next.js.

Welcome to my personal notes. This is where I record thoughts on frontend
development, motion design, and product thinking.

## Why loading transitions matter

Our eyes are extremely sensitive to **consistency in motion**. A good loading
transition is not just decoration — it communicates state:

- The current page has finished its job
- A new context is being constructed
- The user is still in control of the interaction

## A small, reusable pattern

For this site I chose a very lightweight CSS-based transition:

- Use `keyframes` to animate opacity + translateY
- Use `key={pathname}` in the layout to force the animation on route change
- Keep the total duration around 400ms so it feels quick but not abrupt

In the future I might reach for heavier tools like Framer Motion for more
complex flows, but this pattern is a good baseline: easy to reason about,
easy to remove, and hard to break.
