Welcome to my personal notes. This is where I record thoughts on frontend
development, motion design, and product thinking.

## Starting with the Tag component

The Tag component used on this page is intentionally small in scope:

1. A \`variant\` prop to control emphasis
2. A compact size that never dominates the layout
3. Enough contrast to stay readable on a dark background

Over time I want to add more content components — callouts, timelines, richer
code blocks — so the articles feel more like small products than plain text.
