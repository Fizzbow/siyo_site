Welcome to my personal notes. This is where I record thoughts on frontend
development, motion design, and product thinking.

## Information architecture: clarify the entry points

For a personal site, I mainly care about three questions:

1. Can visitors immediately tell who I am from the hero?
2. Can they quickly find the blog, projects, and contact?
3. Do animations support comprehension instead of competing for attention?

## Visual language: what I borrowed from Linear

From Linear I borrowed a few ideas:

- A dark base with soft, layered lighting
- A simple but very clear hierarchy
- Tiny micro-interactions on almost everything

Together these choices keep the interface calm while still feeling alive.
