Current version **`3.2`**

## Release Process SOP

### 1) Tag 3.2 and Create Maintenance Branch

> Confirm completed commits for 3.2

```jsx
git log --oneline
```

> Tag 3.2 (if not already tagged)

```bash
git tag -a v3.2 -m "release 3.2"
```

> Create maintenance branch from v3.2 (long-lived, for 3.2.x revisions)

```bash
git switch -c release/3.2 v3.2
git push -u origin release/3.2
git push origin v3.2

```

> For any future requirements that "must be based on 3.2", work on release/3.2.

---

### 2) Continue New Version Development on Main Branch

Common practice: `main` for stable releases; `develop` for daily iterations (if you have this branch). Choose either as your main branch.

> Continue new version development (e.g., 3.3 or 4.0)

```bash
git switch develop        # or main
```

> Update version number to 3.3.0 (or 4.0.0), and proceed with normal feature branch iterations.

---

### 3) ⭐️ PM Needs Changes on 3.2: Use Patch Version 3.2.x

> Implement changes on release/3.2, then release 3.2.1, 3.2.2... (incrementing patch number)

```bash
git switch release/3.2

```

> For changes based on 3.2, it's recommended to create a new patch branch

```bash
git switch -c fix/abc-on-3.2

```

> Develop and commit

```bash
git commit -m "fix(3.2): Fix ABC issue"
```

> Merge back to release/3.2

```bash
git switch release/3.2
git merge --no-ff fix/abc-on-3.2
git push
```

> After verification passes, tag the patch version and release

```bash
# Update version file to 3.2.1 (e.g., package.json, pom.xml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
git commit -am "chore: bump version to 3.2.1"

git tag -a v3.2.1 -m "release 3.2.1"
git push origin release/3.2
git push origin v3.2.1

```

---

### 4) Sync 3.2 Fixes Back to Main Branch (Prevent Regression)

Typically use `cherry-pick` to sync fixes to `develop/main`:

```bash
# Note the fix commit SHA on release/3.2, e.g., abc1234
git switch develop        # or main
git cherry-pick -x abc1234
git push
```

---

### 5) Reverse Scenario: Fixed on Main First, Want to Backport to 3.2?

Similarly, `cherry-pick` back to `release/3.2`:

```bash
git switch release/3.2
git cherry-pick -x <main branch fix commit SHA>
git push
```

> Then follow the 3.2.x release process (e.g., 3.2.2, etc.)

## 🧩 Naming and Convention Recommendations

- **Branch Naming:**
  - `release/3.2`: Maintenance branch
  - `feature/*`: New features
  - `fix/*`: Bug fixes
  - `hotfix/*`: Urgent production fixes
- **Tags:** `vMajor.Minor.Patch`, e.g., `v3.2.1`
- **Version Numbers Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**
  - Patch: `3.2.1`, `3.2.2` (backward-compatible fixes)
  - Minor: `3.3.0` (backward-compatible new features)
  - Major: `4.0.0` (breaking changes)
- **Protected Branches:** Protect `main` / `release/3.2`, requiring PR and CI approval before merging.
